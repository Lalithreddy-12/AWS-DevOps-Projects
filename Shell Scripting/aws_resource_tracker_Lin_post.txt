🌱 Learning DevOps by Building, Breaking & Fixing

I just completed a hands-on mini project where I built an AWS Resource Tracking system using Shell Scripting and AWS CLI.

What started as a simple script turned into deep learning around:

• IAM permissions & access errors
• AWS regions (yes, a small typo can break everything 😅)
• Parsing AWS JSON output using jq
• Automating reports with cron jobs

Writing cleaner, production-style shell scripts and finally seeing my EC2 instance details correctly appear after debugging everything was a huge confidence boost.

Planning to extend this with AWS Cost Explorer and alerting next 🚀
