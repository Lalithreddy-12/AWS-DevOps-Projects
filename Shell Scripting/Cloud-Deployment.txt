I learned how real-world deployments work by: 🔹 Assigning an Elastic IP to maintain a static public address 🔹 Configuring Security Groups to allow HTTP/HTTPS access 🔹 Cloning my project from Git and serving it using Nginx This experience gave me hands-on exposure to cloud infrastructure, networking, and web server configuration. Feeling excited and motivated to dive deeper into Cloud & DevOps 🚀 #AWS #EC2 #Nginx #Linux #DevOps #CloudComputing #LearningByDoing in this version, make it slightly excited
